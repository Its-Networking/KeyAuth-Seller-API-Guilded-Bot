# KeyAuth-Seller-API-Guilded-Bot
This is a Guilded Bot made for the KeyAuth Seller API. It has every feature that is on https://keyauth.readme.io. 

## How Do I Set It Up?
1. Download the folder, this contains everything that you need. 
2. Open Guiled KeyAuth Seller Bot > bin > Debug > net7.0 > config.json 
3. You will need to add your Guilded Bot Token, your KeyAuth seller key, a prefix of your choosing, and the Guilded channel ID that you would like to receive logs in. The logs will simply tell you the response for each request you make so you can go back and view all the requests. This comes in handy if you are working with a team. 

**there are two ways to run the bot now**
1. You can simply run the .exe and it'll notify you once it's connected, and as long as you have that open you can run any command (learn about 24/7 hosting below).
2. If you would like to view the code first, or if the .exe isn't working properly. Go back to the root and open the .sln file in Visual Studio. Then simply click the green start button (debug button) on the top middlish of Visual Studio. 

## What perms do I need? 
By default anyone can use the bot. It isn't role/user based so if you allow all users in your server to access commands, I'd be careful using this. It's recommended that you disable bot commands for all other users, at least for this bot in order to limit the requests and prevent spam.

## Can I change the code? 
If you would like to change the code/commands/etc to make it more efficient for you/others, you may do so, however, you must give me/KeyAuth credit for using this "base". No one likes a paster that doesn't give credit .-. -.-
